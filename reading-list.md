- [RepairThemAll](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11973.pdf) READ-PATCHES
  - 23,551 Repair Attempts on 5 benchmarks using 11 Java test suit based tools. 

- [ODS](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9399306) 2022 READ-STUDY
  - Classify overfitting patches by extracting 202 code features.
  - They used sanity check and Evosuits to obtain a labeled dataset.
  - 3 patch datasets have been used 2 of them are labeled (Wang's and Xiong's) 1 is not labeled (RepairThemAll)
 
- [DL4PatchCorrectness](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3324884.3416532)
- - Uses 3 patch datasets (Xiong's and APR-Efficiency - labeled) and (repairthemall - not-labeled)
 
- [GumTree](https://hal.science/hal-01054552/document) 2014 READ-ALGORITHM
  - introduces new gumtree algorithm to map nodes of two ASTs and then the mapping is used to generate an edit script.
 
- [Coming](https://github.com/SpoonLabs/coming)  2018
  - A tool to mine patterns from github
  - Also can be run for two files (Other options exist)
  - Also can generate ODS's features (ODS uses Coming to get the features)
 
- [BFS small medium](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3340544) 2019 READ-BENCHMARK
  - mines open source repos and maps methods. considers each changed method as a bug. generates abstractions and edit script for bug-fix pairs.
