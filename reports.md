### Other Issues

While fetching data from [4] I found that [3] does not include the following patches:
- Lang_35 ACS,
- Math_35 ARJA,
- Closure_21 jGenProg,(But [3] has a GenProg-A patch for Closure_21)
- Closure_21 jKali, (Same as Closure_21's case, it has a Kali-A patch)
- Closure_22 jKali, (Same as Closure_21's case)
- Lang_7 jKali, (Same as Closure_21's case)
- Math_72 SimFix,
- Lang_10 jKali,(Same as Closure_21's case)
- Math_50 jKali,(Same as Closure_21's case)

In [ODS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.12057.pdf) diff line ranges are different for various patches. Isn't it an issue?

In ReapairThemAll [9]. They include only part of patches 1092/60,000. Besides they have 1098 patches but 6 of them do not have diffs.
